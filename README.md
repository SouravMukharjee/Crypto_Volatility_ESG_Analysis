# Exploring Sustainability Metrics
This repository contains research exploring the link between cryptocurrency volatility and sustainability uncertainty, measured by the **ESG Uncertainty Index (ESGUI)**. The study highlights how environmental, social, and governance uncertainty affects crypto markets and the potential spillover to traditional financial and energy markets.
